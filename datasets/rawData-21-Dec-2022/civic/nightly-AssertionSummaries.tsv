Mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene are the most common mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). 5 to 10% of AML is associated with activating point mutations in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), particularly at the D835 residue. FLT3 D835 mutations are a common mechanism of clinical resistance to type II FLT3 inhibitors (sorafenib, quizartinib and ponatinib), which bind only the inactive kinase conformation. However, gilteritinib, a type I oral inhibitor of FLT3 and AXL, demonstrated preclinical activity against type II FLT3 inhibitor resistance-conferring D835 mutations and clinical activity as monotherapy in Relapsed/Refractory (R/R) FLT3-mutated AML in multiple clinical trials. The 2017 FDA approved FLT3 mutation companion diagnostic assay can detect a D835 or I836 mutation, but cannot distinguish which of these residues is mutated. In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved gilteritinib as the first FLT3 inhibitor indicated for use as monotherapy for R/R AML with FLT3 D835. NCCN AML guidelines classify gilteritinib as a category 1 recommendation for R/R AML patients harboring FLT3 D835 mutations.	33	7283,8106,8108,8351,7728	437	24	2022-04-09 01:33:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/33	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7283,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8106,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8108,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8351,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7728	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/437	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/24	false

FLT3	2322	ITD	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119		Gilteritinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity/Response		Tier I - Level A	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	2.2021	true	true	FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are sensitive to Gilteritinib, a Type I FLT3 inhibitor.	The constitutively activating FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation appears in approximately 20-30% of AML patients and are associated with high risk, high relapse rates and poor clinical outcome. The type I selective second-generation oral inhibitor, gilteritinib, received initial global approval for use to treat adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FLT3 ITD positive AML in Japan in September 2018. Based on interim results of the ADMIRAL trail (Perl AE, et al., 2019), the FDA approved the drug for treatment of adult R/R AML with FLT3 ITD mutations in November 2018. The FDA approved companion diagnostic, LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation assay. NCCN AML guidelines classify gilteritinib as a category 1 recommendation for R/R AML patients harboring FLT3 ITD.	38	7728,8924,8923,7283	55	24	2022-04-09 01:33:36 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/38	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7728,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8924,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8923,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7283	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/55	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/24	false
NTRK3	4916	ETV6::NTRK3	B-lymphoblastic Leukemia/lymphoma	0080630		Larotrectinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity/Response		Tier II - Level C			false	false	ETV6-NTRK3–positive B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia patients can be sensitive to larotrectinib	An ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion can be seen in ∼1% of “Philadelphia-like” B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases. The TRK pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancer types, with NTRK fusions being the best characterized. Larotrectinib and entrectinib are NTRK inhibitors that are FDA approved for patients with NTRK fusion-positive solid tumors, including tumors with ETV6-NTRK3 fusions, and are reported to have durable NTRK inhibition. Evaluating response of ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in B-ALL cases to larotrectinib is difficult due to the rarity of the fusion in this cancer type. However, in a limited number of clinical cases of ETV6-NTRK3 in B-ALL, patients harboring these fusions have responded to larotrectinib. One patient demonstrated a response to treatment that was lost on discontinuation of therapy but showed durable response achieving remission on restarting laroterctinib [civic:eid8917]. The functional impact of ETV6-NTRK3 has been demonstrated through increased tumorigenic properties in mice, which mimic human B-ALL [civic:eid8931] and enhanced sensitivity to Larotrectinib both in vivo and in vitro [civic:eid6930]. These pre-clinical and limited clinical studies show that ETV6-NTRK3 fusion-positive B-ALL may demonstrate response to larotrectinib with minimal adverse effects similar to solid tumors for which these are FDA-approved.	39	7993,6099,8930,8931,8917,6930,7496	801	3985	2022-04-18 20:51:00 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/39	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7993,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6099,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8930,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8931,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/8917,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/6930,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7496	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/801	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/3985	false

Few cases have been described but when available, microarray expression signatures from patients harboring these fusions, show a Ph-like signature. Co-occurrence with IKZF1 deletions has been described in 2 patients. Relatively short overall survival has also been implied in these rare patients, consistent with the poor outcomes associated with Ph-like B-ALL.	43	7254,7694,9178,9177,7241,7744	2678	4	2022-04-18 20:52:43 UTC	https://civicdb.org/links/assertions/43	https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7254,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7694,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9178,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/9177,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7241,https://civicdb.org/links/evidence_items/7744	https://civicdb.org/links/variants/2678	https://civicdb.org/links/genes/4	false
