1183632195	2015-09-14	Update	Added another supporting VA. I think this is enough to say the results are replicated, so this would move to level 2. Since ABCB1 is a VIP, this makes the CA a level 2A.
1183632195	2015-09-14	Update	I changed the wording on the CA slightly to remove "postoperative" since the replicating study looked at chemotherapy induced nausea. Also, the postoperative study saw an association during the first few hours, but not long term. Likewise, the chemotherapy study saw an association during the acute phase but not delayed phase. So wording was added to say the association was found "shortly" (undefined) after ondansetron treatment.
