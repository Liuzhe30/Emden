This annotation is not used for clinical annotation scoring. Article designed about c.1129–5923C>G as additional risk variant and not to detect association with toxicity and c.1679T>G In the conclusion the authors state: "....c.1129–5923C>G DPYD variant as a predictive marker of early‐onset FP toxicity in a “real‐world” clinical setting. We estimate that fewer than 50 patients need to be screened prior to therapy for this variant and for c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G and c.2846A>T in order to prevent one case of severe FP toxicity."

This annotation is not used for clinical annotation scoring. Article designed about c.1129–5923C>G as additional risk variant and not to detect association with toxicity and c.1679T>G In the conclusion the authors state: "....c.1129–5923C>G DPYD variant as a predictive marker of early‐onset FP toxicity in a “real‐world” clinical setting. We estimate that fewer than 50 patients need to be screened prior to therapy for this variant and for c.1905+1G>A, c.1679T>G and c.2846A>T in order to prevent one case of severe FP toxicity."

This annotation is not used for clinical annotation scoring. Lack of a statistically significant association was likely due to the low frequency of the allele in the population (only 4 patients with the AC genotype). No significant increase in risk of experiencing grade 3 or higher adverse events, either 5-fluorouracil-related adverse events or overall adverse events.
